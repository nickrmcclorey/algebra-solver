#Algebra Solver
Taking algebraic expressions as strings and solving
This program can evaluate simple algebraic expressions.
It can add, subtract, mutiply and divide but it can't raise anything to a power.
There can only be one instance of a variable.
I hope to add support for exponents as well as polynomial multiplication in expressions with variables.
