###Algebra Solver
Taking algebraic expressions as strings and solving
This program can evaluate simple algebraic expressions.
It can add, subtract, mutiply and divide but it can't raise anything to a power.
There can only be one instance of a variable.
I hope to add support for exponents as well as polynomial multiplication in expressions with variables.

### Compiling and Running
Javac and Java must be installed and added to your path.
Clone the repository and open a terminal in the project folder.
Type "javac algebra/Algebra_main.java"
If you don't get any errors, run the program by typing
"java algebra.Algebra_main"
