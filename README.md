### Algebra Solver
This program takes in algebra problems as a string and finds the answer.
This program can evaluate simple algebraic expressions.
It can add, subtract, mutiply and divide but it can't raise anything to a power.
There can only be one instance of a variable.
I hope to add support for multiple instances of a variable, exponents as well as polynomial multiplication in expressions with variables.

### Compiling and Running
A java sdk must be installed. the `java` and `javac` commands must be added to your path.
Clone the repository and open a terminal in the project folder.
Type "javac algebra/Algebra_main.java"
If you don't get any errors, run the program by typing
"java algebra.Algebra_main"

```
git clone https://github.com/nickrmcclorey/algebra-solver.git
cd algebra-solver
javac algebra/Algebra_main.java
java algebra.Algebra_main
```
